    <div class="comingSoon">
      Between May 12th and 14th, we will be hosting a virtual festival with a
      series of pre-recorded talks, panels, and other exciting presentation
      formats. This is not what youâ€™d expect, folks. Grab some popcorn or a
      martini and tune in. Schedule and speakers will be announced on Monday,
      April 27th.<br /><br />In addition to these live events, an associated
      digital exhibition will showcase our work in the context of six general
      themes. Our memoirs ask that the self be re-examined, we reflect upon our
      consumptive habits, discover new avenues for self-care, create new
      solutions for problems, articulate ourselves in new ways, and generate
      fresh questions to be explored.
